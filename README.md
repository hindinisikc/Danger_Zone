Disaster Simulation Game for Senior High School DRR Education
 Project Overview



The Disaster Simulation Game is an educational first-person simulation developed using Unity for the Senior High School Department of Central Philippine University.
It aims to provide an interactive and immersive method of assessing student learning outcomes in the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) course.




By placing students in realistic disaster environments, the game allows them to apply their knowledge and make critical decisions in simulated scenarios, fostering experiential learning through gameplay.

 Desired State of Technology



The goal is to shift from traditional assessment methods (quizzes, written tests) to experiential learning, where students demonstrate understanding through action, decision-making, and problem-solving in simulated environments.




The system encourages:

Practical application of DRR principles
Development of critical thinking and decision-making
Peer collaboration and healthy competition through a leaderboard system
Statement of the Problem



Traditional DRR assessment methods rely heavily on rote memorization and written examinations, leading to:

Limited evaluation of students’ real-world skills
Minimal feedback for improvement
High stress and anxiety
A “one size fits all” learning approach



This simulation game addresses those limitations through interactive learning.

Objectives of the System
General Objective



To create a first-person disaster simulation game to assess the learning outcomes of Grade 12 students enrolled in the Disaster Risk Reduction course.

Specific Objectives
Develop multiple game stages based on different disasters with increasing difficulty
Integrate gameplay mechanics aligned with DRR concepts
Implement a point-based scoring and leaderboard system
Generate reports of student performance
Scope and Limitations
Scope
Designed for Grade 12 Senior High School students of Central Philippine University
Built with the Unity Game Engine (C#)
Covers key disaster types relevant to the Philippines:
Earthquake
Typhoon
Flash Flood
Fire
Landslide
Volcanic Eruption
Tsunami
Limitations
May require high-end hardware to run smoothly
Teachers will need training for game-based assessment integration
Time constraints may affect optimization and polish
Significance of the Study



This project promotes a gamified approach to education, transforming the learning process into an engaging, social, and interactive experience.
It encourages critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration among students, while also helping teachers gain better insights into how students respond to real-world DRR challenges.

Technologies Used
Unity Game Engine (C#)
Visual Studio / VS Code (for scripting)
Git & GitHub (version control)
Blender / Unity Asset Store (for 3D models)
Adobe Photoshop / GIMP (for textures & UI)
⚙️ Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disaster-simulation-game.git
cd disaster-simulation-game

Open the project in Unity Hub (recommended Unity version: 2021.3+).
Allow Unity to load the assets and dependencies.
Press Play to start testing the simulation.
Gameplay Overview
Players navigate different disaster scenarios using first-person controls.
Each level presents a situation where the player must respond appropriately using DRR knowledge.
Correct decisions earn points; poor decisions reduce scores.
Leaderboards track overall student performance.
